## Welcome to Backspin Flying!
Ever tried putting backspin in ping-pong (table tennis) and watch the ball fly off the table? It's the result of a physics force called the Magnus effect, and fun stuff happens when a ball spins fast enough!
A mouse is recommended to play this game. (Keyboard-only controls below)

Controls:

-mouse left/right click

---KEYBOARD CONTROLS---

-z/x , left/right arrow keys - shoot left/right respectively, same as mouse clicks
