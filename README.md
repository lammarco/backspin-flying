## Welcome to Backspin Flying!
Ever tried putting backspin in ping-pong (table tennis) and watch the ball fly off the table? It's the result of a physics force called the Magnus effect, and fun stuff happens when a ball spins fast enough!
A mouse is recommended to play this game. (Keyboard-only controls below)

Controls:

-mouse left/right click

-pause/play button in the upper-right corner

-mute/unmute the background music (bgm) and sound effects (sfx) in the pause menu

---KEYBOARD CONTROLS---

-z/x , left/right arrow keys - shoot left/right respectively, same as mouse clicks

-m - mute/unmute the bgm (even when the game is not paused)

-n - mute/unmute the sfx (even when the game is not paused)
